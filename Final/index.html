    <h2> This site includes photos from my favorite projects, interesting facts about graphic design, ways to contact me, and some of my design inspiration! </h2>
    <!-- <p> Throughout my life I have gained my passions from creativity and art. I grew up knitting with my grandma, going to painting classes at my local art gallery, and going to art museums with my big sister. Ever since then, my goals and motivations have revolved around my love for the arts. I have had an interesting journey switching my major from Art Practices, to Film, to now Media Design. I also ventured from Art History to now Technology, Arts, and Media. Although some would say I have switched one too many times, every major and minor I have experienced has been guiding me to where I am now in school and even what I plan to do for my career after I graduate. This webpage is three of my favorite projects I have created throughout the past two years as a Media Design major. These are the projects I hope will help me in my journey of finding a job. My silly passions when I was little are now what are inspiring my goals for my future. Some of these goals include wanting to help new brands that are small, environmentally friendly, and unique find their identity through branding. Going on from there, I also want to help friends and family create a voice for their business through designing their brand identity- which I have already started to do, and I love it!  My motivation for these goals is the extreme satisfaction and joy I get from designing. School has always been difficult for me, but art is the one thing I have always felt to be good at. Graphic design and the famous designers that have changed the way we look at everyday life is also so motivational due to how impactful the field truly is. I hope my goals are not only met, but succeeded and I can't wait to see what else I am able to accomplish and design! </p> -->
