      <h1>The Coffee Culture</h1>
      <p>One of the world's most popular drinks, coffee dates back to the 9th century. It is said that Kaldi, a young goatherder from Ethiopia, tried the local berries and brought them home. Despite, coffee beans are actually seeds - specifically, 'coffee bean' is the pit of a coffee cherry. Although coffee comes from cherries, not grapes, the word originated from 'wine' - the Arabic term "qahwah". The Dutch then named it "koffie" followed by the English name that was derived in 15</p>82.</p>
